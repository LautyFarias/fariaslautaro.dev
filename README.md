This is my web resume, inspired by [BartoszJarocki/cv](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv).

## ðŸ”§ Stack

I used [Astro](https://astro.build/) to improve the performance, building a static page that just uses HTML + CSS.

I became interested in Astro thanks to [Midudev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwh92LTB-Bk)

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
